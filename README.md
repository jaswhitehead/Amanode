# Amanode - Where Amazon meets Node!
This is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and node in a CLI application environment. The app will take 
in orders from customers, show if there is not enough inventory to complete a purchase and deplete stock from the store's inventory after the purchase is made. 

In the managerial portal, the user can view all inventory, see what inventory is running low, add stock to any item or input a brand new item all together. Please view the videos below to see how it works as this is a command line application and cannot be run remotely.
